    This project would not have been possible without the generous input and patience
    of tournament organizers and directors who worked with early versions of CourtHive/TMX.

    Thanks to Pavel, Ivan, Mladen, Zdenko, Antoina, Jakov, Kreso, Barry, Jeff... to name just a few. 

    The project would not have even begun without the support of Miro, or the introduction by Sretchko.
    The project would not have succeeded without the enthusiasm of Randy and Bruce.
    Thanks to serendipity and Luca and the ensuing TODS conversations with ITF.
    Thanks to Dave for backing the conversion of TMX 1.x source into the factory repository.

    And a special thanks to my family for putting up with the long days and weeks and months of coding
    and conversations at all hours.
