This can be accomplished by dividing a draw structure into sections based on the number of players within a given group and distributing a group's players evenly across these sections, randomizing section placement if there are more sections than players in a given group.  This process would be repeated for each group starting with the largest group.  There are scenarios where players in smaller groups end up having only adjacent positions available when it comes to their distribution which necessitates a shuffling step for previously placed groups.`}</p>\n\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;\n      "],"sourceRoot":""}
